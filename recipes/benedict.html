    <h1>Naked Eggs Benedict</h1>

    <p>These naked eggs Benedict are a stripped-down version that involves no poaching of eggs, and they are not covered in heavy Hollandaise sauce, but are sauced with a lighter lemon butter sauce. And yet, the taste is virtually identical to classic eggs Benedict.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Lemon Sauce</li>
        <li>Assemble</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 (5 ounce) ramekins (or 2 wells of a standard muffin tin) with melted butter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Line each ramekin with two slices of ham, being sure to get the edges even around the top. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Crack 1 egg into a small bowl; gently transfer to a ham-lined ramekin; repeat with the second egg. Season each egg with salt and cayenne, to taste.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until the whites are just barely set, and the yolks are still soft and a little runny, 20 to 25 minutes. The eggs will continue to cook and set more firmly once removed from the oven if left in the hot ramekins.
        </li>
        <li>Toast and butter English muffins, transfer baked ham and eggs onto muffin halves, and spoon warm sauce over. Sprinkle with chives and serve immediately.
        </li>
    </ol>
